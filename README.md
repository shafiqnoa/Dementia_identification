There are two non-imputed data sets, one in hg38 version and another one in hg19 version. 
Other NBR30 files were on hg19 version. Therefore h38 version is convertec to hg19 version. 
Imputation is being performed using sanger imputation server for non-imputed data using HRC as reference panel. 
Previousl files were imputed using same platform and reference panel.
